Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.
 

Write an SQL query to report the nth highest salary from the Employee table. If there is no nth highest salary, the query should report null.

SYNTAX -> 

SELECT column_list  
FROM table_name  
LIMIT offset, count;  
OFFSET--> kitne chodne hai 
count-> rows that you want to print 

SELECT distinct salary FROM Employee ORDER BY salary desc LIMIT M,1
