Given a directed graph. The task is to do Breadth First Traversal of this graph starting from 0.
Note: One can move from node u to node v only if there's an edge from u to v and find the BFS traversal 
of the graph starting from the 0th vertex, from left to right according to the graph. Also, you should 
only take nodes directly or indirectly connected from Node 0 in consideration.


Example 1:

Input:

Output: 0 1 2 3 4
Explanation: 
0 is connected to 1 , 2 , 3.
2 is connected to 4.
so starting from 0, it will go to 1 then 2
then 3.After this 2 to 4, thus bfs will be
0 1 2 3 4.
Example 2:

Input:

Output: 0 1 2
Explanation:
0 is connected to 1 , 2.
so starting from 0, it will go to 1 then 2,
thus bfs will be 0 1 2 3 4. 

Your task:
You donâ€™t need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function bfsOfGraph() 
which takes the integer V denoting the number of vertices and adjacency list as input parameters and returns  
a list containing the BFS traversal of the graph starting from the 0th vertex from left to right.


Expected Time Complexity: O(V + E)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(V)



SOLUTION-

FOR DIRECTED GRAPH BFS CODE -


class Solution {
  public:
    // Function to return Breadth First Traversal of given graph.
    vector<int> bfsOfGraph(int V, vector<int> adj[]) {
       vector<int> bfs;
       queue <int> q;
       vector <int> vis(V+1,0);
         q.push(0);
         vis[0]=1;
             
             // HERE We don't have to write for loop as we don't have to check for each node as it is directed, neither we need to check visited bcoz in directed 
             //graph we can traverse from u to v but not from v to u
              
       while(!q.empty()){
           int node = q.front();
           q.pop();
           bfs.push_back(node);
           
           for(auto it:adj[node]){
               if(!vis[it]){
                   q.push(it);
                   vis[it]=1;
               }
           }
       }
           
       
       return bfs;
    }
};

FOR UNDIRECTED GRAPH BFS CODE -


class Solution {
  public:
    // Function to return Breadth First Traversal of given graph.
    vector<int> bfsOfGraph(int V, vector<int> adj[]) {
       vector<int> bfs;
       queue <int> q;
       vector <int> vis(V+1,0);
       for(int i=0;i<V;i++){
           if(!vis[i]){
               q.push(i);
               vis[i]=1;
               while(!q.empty()){
                   int node = q.front();
                   q.pop();
                   bfs.push_back(node);
                   
                   for(auto it:adj[node]){
                       if(!vis[it]){
                           q.push(it);
                           vis[it]=1;
                       }
                   }
               }
           }
       }
       return bfs;
    }
};
